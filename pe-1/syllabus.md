Generally, Python is a great choice for:

- Web and Internet development (e.g., Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)
- Scientific and numeric computing (e.g., SciPy - a collection of packages for the purposes of mathematics, science, and engineering; Ipython - an interactive shell that features editing and recording of work sessions)
- Education (it's a brilliant language for teaching programming! And that's why we're offering this course to you!)
- Desktop GUIs (e.g., wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt)
- Software Development (build control, management, and testing - Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)
- Business applications (ERP and e-commerce systems - Odoo, Tryton)
